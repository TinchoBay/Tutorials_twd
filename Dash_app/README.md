# Fatal Road Accidents (FRA) Dashboard

## Description

This project aims to visualize fatal road accidents (FRA) data in Athens from 2011 to 2015 using Dash, a Python framework for building analytical web applications. The dashboard allows users to explore FRA data based on vehicle type and year, presenting visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and a map.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed. This project is developed using Python 3.
3. Install the required libraries by running:

pip install pandas dash plotly numpy

4. Run the application by executing the following command:

Dash_App_FRA app.py

5. Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050/ to view the dashboard.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, users are presented with options to select a vehicle type and year. Based on the selection, the dashboard dynamically updates to display relevant visualizations:

- **Bar Charts**: Displays the distribution of age groups involved in fatal road accidents.
- **Pie Chart**: Shows the distribution of accidents based on time of occurrence.
- **Map**: Visualizes the geographic distribution of accidents using a scatter map.

Users can interact with the dashboard to gain insights into the FRA data for Athens.
